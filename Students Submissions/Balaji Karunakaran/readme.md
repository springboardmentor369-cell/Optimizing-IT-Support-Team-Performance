📊 Data Visualization Internship 

This document outlines the concepts, tools, and tasks covered during the Data Visualization Internship. The focus of the internship is to understand how raw data is transformed into meaningful insights using Power BI, Python, and analytics concepts.

🗓️ Week 1 – Introduction to Power BI & Data Cleaning (Power Query)

In the first week, I was introduced to Power BI and learned how to import, clean, and transform raw data using Power Query.

🧹 Data Cleaning in Power BI (Power Query)

Data cleaning is the first and most important step before analysis. In Power BI, data cleaning was performed using Power Query Editor.

🔧 Key Data Cleaning Operations Covered:

✂️ Removing unnecessary columns

🔁 Removing duplicate records

🧼 Handling missing (null) values

🔤 Trimming and cleaning text values

🔄 Changing data types (Text, Number, Date)

📅 Splitting columns (Date into Year, Month, Day)

🔗 Renaming columns for better understanding

📉 Filtering rows based on conditions

These steps helped prepare clean and structured data suitable for analysis and visualization.

🗓️ Week 2 – Data Cleaning Using Python (Google Colab)

In the second week, I learned how to perform data cleaning using Python to understand programmatic data preparation.

🐍 Tools and Techniques Used:

📦 Pandas library for data manipulation

❌ Handling missing values using dropna() and fillna()

🔁 Removing duplicates

✏️ Renaming columns

🔢 Correcting data types

📤 Exporting cleaned data as CSV / Excel files

This helped me understand how Python can be used alongside Power BI for preprocessing large datasets.

🗓️ Week 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the third week, I learned about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and its importance before building dashboards.

🔍 Key EDA Activities:

📊 Understanding data distribution

📈 Identifying trends and patterns

🧮 Checking summary statistics

❓ Framing business-related analytical questions

🎬 Practical Task:

EDA was performed on a Netflix dataset, and analytical questions were framed to understand:

Content availability

Content growth over years

Ratings distribution

Country-wise content presence

EDA helped connect data analysis with business decision-making.

🗓️ Week 4 – Live API Data Connection

In the fourth week, I learned how to connect live data using APIs in Power BI.

🌐 Key Concepts Covered:

🌍 Connecting APIs using Web connector in Power BI

📄 Understanding JSON data format

🔄 Transforming API data using Power Query

⏱️ Understanding data refresh

⚡ Difference between static data and live data

This helped in understanding how real-time dashboards are built in industry environments.

🗓️ Week 5 – Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

In the fifth week, the focus was on understanding and designing KPIs for performance measurement.

🎯 KPI Concepts Covered:

📌 Identifying meaningful KPIs

🧮 Calculating KPIs using measures

🧾 Displaying KPIs using cards and visuals

🚦 Understanding KPI targets and status

KPIs help in quick decision-making and performance tracking.

🗓️ Week 6 – Data Modeling in Power BI

In the sixth week, I learned about data modeling and how different tables are connected in Power BI.

🧩 Key Data Modeling Concepts:

🔗 Creating relationships between tables

🔢 Cardinality (One-to-Many, One-to-One, Many-to-Many)

🔁 Active and inactive relationships

➡️ Filter direction (Single / Both)

⭐ Importance of proper relationships for accurate calculations

Good data modeling ensures correct filter flow and accurate results in reports.

🗓️ Week 7 – DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

In the seventh week, I was introduced to DAX for creating dynamic calculations in Power BI.

🧠 DAX Concepts Covered:

📐 Base Measures (created from columns)

🧱 Composite Measures (created using measures)

🧠 Understanding that measures return scalar values

🧩 CALCULATE function for applying filters

🔀 Using multiple filters in CALCULATE

🧪 Difference between CALCULATE and slicers

🔍 Conditional logic using IF / ELSE

✨ Formatting DAX for readability using indentation

DAX helped apply business logic and create meaningful insights in dashboards.

📁 Repository Organization

The repository is structured to maintain clarity and organization:

📂 Data Cleaning

📂 Data (Raw & Cleaned Datasets)

📂 Power BI Files

📂 Documentation

📂 Screenshots

This structure helps in tracking progress and maintaining project clarity.
