# Task 1

In the 3rd week my mentor told me to do an task based on EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) , he told us to download netflix dataset and told us to frame 5 questions which will help Netflix Company to make decisions and to make profits. i have framed the questions and i have given the explanations also.

## These are the questions I have Framed : 

1. What is the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows) in the Netflix catalog?

This question focuses on understanding how the total content library is divided between Movies and TV Shows. By calculating the count of each content type, we can identify which format dominates the platform. This helps in understanding the structural composition of the dataset and how content is categorized.

2. How has the number of titles added to Netflix changed over the years?

This question examines the yearly addition of content by analyzing the release year or the year content was added. By grouping titles by year and counting them, we can observe growth trends, stability, or fluctuations in content expansion over time.

3. Which countries contribute the highest number of titles to Netflix?

This question analyzes the country attribute to determine which regions produce the most content available on the platform. By counting titles per country, we can identify geographical distribution patterns within the dataset.

4. What is the distribution of content ratings across the platform?

This question evaluates how titles are categorized based on rating classifications such as TV-MA, PG-13, TV-Y7, etc. By counting titles under each rating category, we can understand the overall audience segmentation reflected in the dataset.

5. What is the trend of content type growth over time?

This question combines content type and year to analyze whether Movies or TV Shows have increased more significantly over time. By comparing yearly counts for each content type, we can detect shifts in production or platform focus across different periods.
