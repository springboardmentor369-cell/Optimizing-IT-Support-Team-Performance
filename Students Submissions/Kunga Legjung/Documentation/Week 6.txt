Internship Week 6 Documentation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
• DAX is a formula language used in Power BI.  
• It is used to calculate values like totals, averages, and percentages.  

DAX Functions  
• DAX functions are built-in formulas that help perform calculations.  
• They make data analysis easier and faster.  

Explicit and Implicit Measures  
• Implicit measures are created automatically when we drag data into visuals.  
• Explicit measures are created by writing DAX formulas.  
• Explicit measures can be reused in many visuals.  

Reusable DAX  
• Reusable DAX means writing a measure once and using it many times.  
• This saves time and keeps results consistent.  

Measures  
• A measure is a calculation used in reports and dashboards.  
• Base measures perform simple calculations.  
• Composite measures use one or more base measures.  

CALCULATE Function  
• CALCULATE is used to change how data is filtered.  
• It helps create advanced calculations based on conditions.  

IF and Logical Functions  
• IF function checks a condition and returns a result.  
• It is used to show different values based on rules.  

DAX Basics in Power BI  
• Learned basic DAX syntax.  
• Practiced writing simple formulas.  
• Understood how DAX helps in decision making.  

Summary  
• Learned DAX in simple and practical way.  
• Understood how measures and functions work.  
• Improved ability to create calculations in Power BI.
