Week 5 – Data Types, Data Modeling & Relationships
🔹 Overview
In the fifth week, we focused on understanding types of data and their importance in analytics. We learned how data types influence chart selection and visualization logic in Power BI.

🔹 Types of Data & Visualization
Categorical data
Numerical data
Time-series data
Selection of appropriate charts:
Bar charts (horizontal and vertical) for categorical data
Pie charts for limited categorical values (5–6 categories, 100% total)
Line charts for time-series data

🔹 Power BI Views
Table View
Model View – understanding relationships between tables
Report View

🔹 Data Modeling Concepts
Primary Key – unique identifier
Foreign Key – references primary key across tables
Fact Tables – contain measurable metrics
Dimension Tables – contain descriptive attributes
Establishing relationships using common columns

🔹 Relationships & Schema
Relationship types: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many
Schema types: Star Schema and Snowflake Schema
Explored data modeling in Power BI Model View

✅ Task Completed
Identified primary and foreign keys in fact and dimension tables

Understood the use of composite primary keys in fact tables
