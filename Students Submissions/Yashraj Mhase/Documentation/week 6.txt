Week 6 – DAX, Measures & Interactive Dashboards
🔹 Overview
In the sixth week, we focused on DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and its role in creating dynamic and interactive Power BI reports. We learned how DAX is used to build measures, calculated columns, and tables for analytical reporting.

🔹 Key DAX Concepts
Fact Tables containing measurable data used for aggregation
Understanding measurable columns for calculations such as SUM and COUNT
Creating DAX measures using business examples (e.g., total profit calculation)

🔹 Types of Measures
Implicit Measures – automatically generated by Power BI using built-in aggregations
Explicit Measures – user-defined DAX formulas providing full control over calculations

🔹 Business Logic in DAX
Creating measures from table columns
Creating composite measures by combining multiple measures
Using CALCULATE with filters to apply conditional logic
Implementing IF and nested IF conditions for decision-based outputs

🔹 Interactivity & Filtering
Using slicers for interactive filtering
Applying FILTER function within CALCULATE for row-level conditions
Enhancing dashboards using conditional formatting

✅ Task Completed
Built dynamic measures and interactive dashboards using DAX functions
