Week 2 – Data Preprocessing Using Python
🔹 Overview
In the second week, we reviewed the cleaned dataset and set up the VS Code environment. We learned how project files and folders are organized and how to work with Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. We were introduced to Pandas and DataFrames for handling and preprocessing tabular data in Python.

🔹 Tools & Concepts Learned
DataFrame: A structured table of rows and columns used for data storage, cleaning, and analysis
Pandas Library: Used to load and manipulate datasets such as CSV and Excel files in Python

🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps
Loaded dataset using Pandas
Removed duplicate records
Trimmed whitespaces and removed special characters from text fields
Replaced categorical values with standardized formats (Yes/No → Y/N)
Filtered out unnecessary rows (e.g., Do Not Contact customers)
Dropped irrelevant and unnamed columns
Handled missing values and removed rows with empty critical fields

✅ Task Completed
Performed data preprocessing on the Customer Call List dataset using Python and Pandas
