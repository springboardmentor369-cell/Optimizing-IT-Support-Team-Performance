# Optimizing-IT-Support-Team-Performance-Using-Analytics

# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to optimize IT support team performance using data analytics
# Problem Statement Description
Modern IT support teams handle large volumes of service requests with varying priorities, service-level agreements (SLAs), and customer expectations. Without systematic analysis, inefficiencies such as delayed ticket resolution, uneven workload distribution, frequent SLA breaches, and declining customer satisfaction often go unnoticed.
This project focuses on optimizing IT support team performance using analytics by transforming raw ticket data into actionable insights. Through Python-based data cleaning and preprocessing and Power BI–driven visualization, the analysis evaluates key performance indicators such as resolution time, SLA compliance, agent productivity, ticket backlog, and customer satisfaction.
The objective is to enable data-driven decision-making that helps IT managers improve operational efficiency, balance workloads, reduce resolution delays, and enhance overall service quality. The outcome is an interactive dashboard and insight-backed recommendations that support continuous performance improvement within IT support operations.

# Dataset (Metadata)
Dataset: IT support ticket dataset

Source: kaggle

Scale: Approximately 8,000+ records with multiple attributes

Dataset Description:It contains recordsof  IT support service desk tickets generated from a simulated organizational support system. It captures operational and performance-related attributes used to evaluate service efficiency and agent productivity.

Key fields Description:

Ticket ID – Unique identifier for each support request

Priority – Severity level of the issue (High, Medium, Low)

Issue Category – Type of problem reported (e.g., Software, Hardware, Network)

Assigned Agent – Support staff responsible for ticket resolution

Created Date – Timestamp when the ticket was raised

Resolved Date – Timestamp when the ticket was closed

Resolution Time (Hours) – Total time taken to resolve the ticket

Status – Current ticket state (Open, In Progress, Resolved)

Customer Satisfaction Score – User feedback rating after resolution

# KPI's - Keep Performance Indicators
1.Total Tickets KPI:It Represents the Total Nuber of Tickets Recorded in the dataset.

2.AVG Priority KPI :It Represents the Average of the priority score assigned to each ticket.

3.AVG Downtime KPI :It Represents the Number of Minutes customers Experienced service downtime per customer satisfaction.

4.Payment Impact Tickets:It Represents the Transaction Issues and It helps to Track the revenue-risk Incidents.

5.AVG Error Rate:It Represents the percentage of Tickets associated with application errors and helps to system reliability.

6.Security Incident: It Represents the percentage of tickets related to security incidents, it's high risk and requires monitoring.

# Key Insights
High-Priority tickets consume 40% More Resolution time.

20% of agents Resoleve 55% of total tickes

SLA breaches spike during peak hours

Low CSAT corelates strongly with delayed resolution.

# Recommendations
Intoduce intelligent ticket routing based on agent expertise.

Balance workload using predictive volume analysis.

Implement SLA(Service Level Agreement) alerts for high-priority tickets.

Provide target training for low-performing agents.

# Conclusion
This project uses Python and Power BI to turn raw IT support ticket data into actionable insights. By analyzing KPIs such as resolution time, SLA compliance, and agent performance, the solution enables data-driven improvements in efficiency, workload balance, and service quality. The end result is an interactive dashboard that supports smarter operational decisions and continuous performance optimization.
